/**
 * Custom Hooks Module
 * 
 * This directory contains custom React hooks for shared logic across components.
 * Hooks should follow React's naming conventions (start with 'use') and be reusable.
 * 
 * Example hooks:
 * - useApi.js - for API calls and data fetching
 * - useAsyncStorage.js - for local storage operations
 * - useKeyboard.js - for keyboard visibility handling
 * - usePermissions.js - for device permissions
 * - useNetworkStatus.js - for network connectivity
 */

// Export all hooks from this file
// Example:
// export { default as useApi } from './useApi';
// export { default as useAsyncStorage } from './useAsyncStorage';
// export { default as useKeyboard } from './useKeyboard';
